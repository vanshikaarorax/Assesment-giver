## Overview

SHL-talent process is an AI-powered recommendation engine designed to streamline the process of selecting SHL assessments for specific job roles. By leveraging natural language processing and semantic search, it helps HR professionals quickly identify the most relevant tests from SHL's extensive catalog, reducing manual effort and improving hiring efficiency.

### The Challenge
HR teams often face difficulties in aligning job requirements with the right SHL assessments. This mismatch can lead to prolonged hiring cycles, suboptimal candidate evaluations, and increased operational costs.

### Our Approach
SHL-talent process addresses this by automating the discovery process: it scrapes SHL's product catalog, converts assessment descriptions into vector embeddings using NLP techniques, performs semantic matching against job descriptions, and delivers tailored recommendations along with actionable HR insights.

## Technology Stack
- **Backend:** FastAPI with Uvicorn for robust API handling
- **AI and Machine Learning:** ChromaDB for vector storage and retrieval, Sentence-Transformers for embedding generation
- **Natural Language Processing:** Cohere API for generating concise insights
- **Data Scraping:** BeautifulSoup and Requests for reliable web extraction
- **Frontend:** Streamlit for an intuitive user interface
- **Deployment:** Render for API hosting and Streamlit Cloud for the demo application

## How It Works
The system follows a structured pipeline to ensure reliable and scalable performance:

1. **Data Collection:** We scrape SHL's website to gather assessment details and store them in a structured JSON format (handled in `scraper.py`).
2. **Vector Database Setup:** Descriptions are transformed into embeddings and persisted in ChromaDB for efficient querying (via `rag.py`).
3. **API Processing:** User-submitted job descriptions are analyzed to retrieve and rank relevant assessments (in `api.py`).
4. **Insight Generation:** The Cohere API evaluates the top matches to produce summaries on key skills, job level suitability, and practical usage advice.
5. **User Interface:** The frontend accepts job descriptions as input and presents ranked recommendations with embedded insights and tips.
